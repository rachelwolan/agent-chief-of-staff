# Rule: Process Meeting

## Goal

To guide an AI assistant in automatically analyzing meeting transcripts or audio recordings to extract structured notes, key decisions, action items with owners and deadlines, and follow-up tasks. The system then posts formatted summaries to Slack for team visibility, transforming raw meeting content into actionable intelligence.

## Process

1. **Verify Prerequisites**:
   - Confirm Anthropic API key is configured in `.env` (for Claude analysis)
   - Verify Slack bot token is set (for posting summaries)
   - If processing audio: Confirm OpenAI API key is set (for Whisper transcription)
   - Check Slack bot has required permissions (`chat:write`, `channels:read`)
2. **Detect Input Type**:
   - Check file extension to determine if input is audio or text
   - Text formats: `.txt`, `.md`
   - Audio formats: `.mp3`, `.mp4`, `.mpeg`, `.mpga`, `.m4a`, `.wav`, `.webm`
3. **Transcribe Audio** (if applicable):
   - If input is audio file, verify file size is under 25MB (Whisper API limit)
   - Send audio to OpenAI Whisper API for transcription
   - Receive transcript text
   - Save transcript to `transcripts/` directory with same filename (different extension)
4. **Load Transcript**:
   - If input was text, read the file directly
   - If input was audio, use the newly created transcript file
   - Verify transcript has content
5. **Analyze with Meeting Processor Agent**:
   - Load agent configuration from `agents/meeting-processor.md`
   - Send transcript to Claude Sonnet 4.5 with analysis prompt
   - Extract structured information:
     - Meeting summary (2-3 sentences)
     - Key decisions made
     - Action items with owners, deadlines, and priorities
     - Open questions and follow-ups
     - Next steps
6. **Parse Agent Output**:
   - Validate output follows expected schema (Zod validation)
   - Parse action items into structured format
   - Extract owner mentions, due dates, priority levels
   - Organize decisions and next steps
7. **Format for Slack**:
   - Convert analysis into Slack-friendly markdown
   - Add proper formatting (bold, lists, mentions)
   - Structure sections with headers
   - Include emoji indicators for visual clarity
8. **Post to Slack**:
   - Connect to Slack API using bot token
   - Post formatted summary to target channel (default: `#rachels-mcp`)
   - Verify successful posting
9. **Display Confirmation**:
   - Show success message with summary preview
   - Indicate Slack channel where summary was posted
   - Display file path of saved transcript (if audio was transcribed)
10. **Save Metadata**:
    - Log processing details (timestamp, file processed, success/failure)
    - Store metadata for future reference

## Prerequisites

### Environment Variables

Add to `.env`:
```bash
# Required for all features
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_key
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-slack-bot-token

# Required only for audio transcription
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key
```

### Slack Bot Setup

Your Slack bot must have these permissions:
- `chat:write` - Post messages to channels
- `channels:read` - List public channels

To configure:
1. Go to [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/apps)
2. Select your app or create a new one
3. Navigate to OAuth & Permissions
4. Add the required scopes
5. Install/reinstall the app to your workspace
6. Copy the Bot User OAuth Token to `.env`

### Agent Configuration

The agent spec should exist at:
- `agents/meeting-processor.md` - Agent configuration with prompt template

### Directory Structure

```
transcripts/
â”œâ”€â”€ recordings/           # Place audio files here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ meeting.m4a
â”œâ”€â”€ sample-product-sync.txt
â””â”€â”€ [auto-saved transcripts from audio]

agents/
â””â”€â”€ meeting-processor.md  # Agent configuration and prompt

packages/core/src/
â”œâ”€â”€ process-meeting.ts    # Main processor script
â””â”€â”€ services/
    â”œâ”€â”€ transcription.ts  # Whisper API integration
    â””â”€â”€ slack.ts         # Slack posting logic
```

## Features

- **Audio Transcription**: Automatically transcribe audio recordings using OpenAI Whisper API
- **Smart Analysis**: Extract key decisions, action items with owners, deadlines, and priorities
- **Slack Integration**: Post formatted summaries to specified Slack channels
- **Flexible Input**: Process text transcripts or audio files (mp3, m4a, wav, etc.)
- **Structured Output**: Consistent format with sections for decisions, actions, questions, next steps
- **Owner Assignment**: Automatically detect and assign action item owners
- **Priority Detection**: Identify priority levels from meeting context

## Usage

### Process Text Transcript

```bash
npm run meeting:process transcripts/team-sync.txt
```

### Process Audio Recording

```bash
npm run meeting:process transcripts/recordings/meeting.m4a
```

Supported audio formats: mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, webm

**Note**: Whisper API has a 25MB file size limit. For larger files, compress or split them first.

## How It Works

1. **Input Detection**: Automatically detects if input is audio or text
2. **Transcription** (if audio): Uses Whisper API to transcribe and saves transcript to `transcripts/`
3. **Analysis**: Claude Sonnet 4.5 analyzes the transcript using the meeting-processor agent
4. **Extraction**: Parses structured data (decisions, action items, open questions, next steps)
5. **Slack Posting**: Formats and posts summary to `#rachels-mcp` channel

## Output Format

The processor generates:

### Meeting Summary
2-3 sentence overview of what was discussed and outcomes

### Key Decisions
- Major decisions made during the meeting
- Strategic choices and their rationale

### Action Items
Formatted as:
1. **Task description** - Owner: @name | Due: date | Priority: level

Example:
1. **Update Q4 roadmap and communicate to stakeholders** - Owner: @mike | Due: Oct 16 | Priority: High
2. **Document design system guidelines** - Owner: @sarah | Due: Oct 18 | Priority: High

### Open Questions & Follow-ups
- Items needing future discussion or clarification
- Unresolved topics requiring follow-up

### Next Steps

## Customization

### Change Target Slack Channel

Edit `packages/core/src/process-meeting.ts` to change the target channel:

```typescript
const result = await slackClient.postMeetingSummary('your-channel-name', summary);
```

### Modify Agent Behavior

Edit the agent prompt in `agents/meeting-processor.md` to change:
- Output format and structure
- What information to extract
- How to parse action items
- Priority assignment logic
- Owner detection rules

### Adjust Claude Model

Change the model in `agents/meeting-processor.md` frontmatter:

```yaml
---
model: claude-sonnet-4-20250929  # or another model
---
```

## Tips

1. **Better Transcripts**: For audio, use clear recordings with minimal background noise
2. **Name Mentions**: Use clear names in meetings for better action item assignment
3. **Explicit Deadlines**: State deadlines explicitly ("by Friday") for accurate extraction
4. **Save Costs**: Process text transcripts when available instead of re-transcribing audio
5. **Review Output**: Always review the generated summary - AI may miss nuances
6. **Consistent Naming**: Use consistent name formats for better owner attribution

## Troubleshooting

### "OPENAI_API_KEY not found"
- Only needed for audio transcription
- Add to your `.env` file
- Not required for text transcript processing
- Get key from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)

### "Audio file too large"
- Whisper API limit is 25MB
- Compress audio file or split into smaller segments
- Use lower bitrate audio recordings
- Consider using a compression tool like `ffmpeg`

### "Failed to post to Slack"
- Check your `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN` is valid
- Verify bot has access to the target channel
- Ensure bot has `chat:write` permission
- Try inviting the bot to the channel: `/invite @botname`

### "Parsing Issues" / "Action items not detected"
- Agent might not always extract all items perfectly
- Review and edit the transcript for clarity
- Adjust the agent prompt in `agents/meeting-processor.md`
- Ensure speakers state action items clearly during meetings
- Add more explicit language: "Action item: X will do Y by Z"

### "Transcription quality poor"
- Use higher quality audio recordings
- Minimize background noise
- Ensure clear speaker audio
- Consider using external recording tools with noise cancellation

### "File not found"
- Verify file path is correct
- Check file exists in `transcripts/` or `transcripts/recordings/`
- Use absolute or relative paths correctly

## Output
