## Common Issues and Solutions

---

## üîë API Key Issues

### Problem: "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not found in environment"

**Solution:**
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory if it doesn't exist
2. Add your API key: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api...`
3. Get your key from: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys
4. Restart any running servers or processes
5. Verify the key is loaded: `echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (should not be empty)

### Problem: Claude API rate limiting

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages about rate limits exceeded
- 429 HTTP status codes
- Temporary failures followed by success

**Solution:**
- Wait a few minutes before retrying
- Consider upgrading your API plan for higher limits
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Reduce frequency of API calls
- Check your usage at https://console.anthropic.com/

## üìÖ Google Calendar Issues

### Problem: Calendar events not fetching

**Solutions:**
1. Verify OAuth credentials exist in `~/.config/claude/config.json`
2. Check that you've replaced placeholder values:
   - `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` with actual client ID
   - `YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` with actual secret
3. Ensure Google Calendar API is enabled in Google Cloud Console:
   - Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/
   - Navigate to APIs & Services ‚Üí Library
   - Search for "Google Calendar API"
   - Click "Enable"
4. Verify redirect URI matches exactly: `http://localhost:3000/oauth/callback`
5. Re-run authentication flow if credentials changed

### Problem: "Not authorized" errors

**Solutions:**
- Reinstall app to workspace in Google Cloud Console
- Check OAuth scopes include calendar permissions:
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.readonly`
  - `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar.events`
- Verify the calendar email address is correct
- Delete old tokens and re-authenticate:
  ```bash
  rm ~/.config/claude/gmail-token.json
  npm run calendar:auth
  ```

---

## üí¨ Slack Issues

### Problem: Can't invite bot to channel

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure you have User Token Scopes configured (not just Bot Token Scopes)
2. Add these required scopes in Slack App settings:
   - `channels:history` - Read messages from public channels
   - `channels:read` - View basic channel information
   - `groups:history` - Read messages from private channels
   - `users:read` - View people in the workspace
3. Reinstall app to workspace after adding scopes:
   - Go to OAuth & Permissions
   - Click "Reinstall to Workspace"
   - Approve the new permissions
4. Use the User OAuth Token (`xoxp-...`) instead of just Bot token
5. For private channels, invite bot manually: `/invite @rachels_slack_agent`

### Problem: Bot can't read messages

**Solutions:**
- For private channels: Use `/invite @rachels_slack_agent` to add bot
- Check bot has correct permissions in Slack app settings
- Verify both Bot Token (`xoxb-...`) and User Token (`xoxp-...`) are configured in `.env`
- Ensure MCP server is running (check with `/mcp` command in Claude)
- Test bot can see channel:
  ```bash
  # List channels the bot can see
  curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $SLACK_BOT_TOKEN" \
    https://slack.com/api/conversations.list
  ```

- Server won't start

**Solution:**
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000

# Kill the process
kill -9 [PID]

# Or change port in server.js
# Edit apps/agent-manager/server.js
# Change: const PORT = 3000; to const PORT = 3001;
```

### Problem: Agents not showing up

**Solutions:**
- Ensure agent files are in `/agents` directory
- Check files have `.md` extension (not `.txt`)
- Verify markdown format is correct (frontmatter, proper structure)

  // Incorrect (will fail)
  import { foo } from './bar';
  ```
- Check `tsconfig.json` has correct module settings:
  ```json
  {
    "compilerOptions": {
      "module": "ESNext",
      "moduleResolution": "node"
    }
  }
  ```
- Verify Node.js version supports ES modules (v14.13.0+):
  ```bash
  node --version
  ```
- Ensure `package.json` has `"type": "module"`

## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Logs

Always start by checking logs:
- **Agent execution logs**: `/logs` directory
- **Browser console**: Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console
- **Server logs**: Terminal where `npm start` is running
- **System logs**: Check for OS-level errors

### Verify Configuration

```bash
# Check MCP config
cat ~/.config/claude-code/mcp.json

# Check environment variables
cat .env

# Verify API keys are set (shows yes/no, not actual key)
[ -z "$ANTHROPIC_API_KEY" ] && echo "Not set" || echo "Set"

# Check if servers are running
ps aux | grep node
```

### Test Components Individually

Isolate the problem by testing each component:

1. **Test API key**:
   ```bash
   node dist/cli.js quick agents/task-manager.md
   ```

2. **Test MCP**:
   - Ask Claude Code: "What MCP servers are available?"
   - Should list configured servers

3. **Test web server**:
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3000/api/agents
   # Should return JSON list of agents
   ```

4. **Test specific integrations**:
   ```bash
   # Google Calendar
   npm run calendar:today

   # Slack
   npm run slack:test

   # Dossier
   npm run dossier:generate
   ```

## üÜò Getting Help

When you need additional help:

1. **Check Documentation**: Review files in `/docs` directory:
   - `/docs/setup.md` - Setup instructions
   - `/docs/quick-start.md` - Getting started
   - `/docs/reference/` - Detailed references

2. **GitHub Issues**: Report bugs at the project repository
   - Include error messages
   - Provide reproduction steps
   - Attach relevant logs

3. **Claude Code**: Ask Claude for assistance:
   - Describe the problem clearly
   - Share error messages
   - Explain what you've tried

4. **Logs**: Always check `/logs` directory for detailed error messages:
   ```bash
   # View recent logs
   ls -lt logs/ | head

   # Read latest log
   cat logs/$(ls -t logs/ | head -1)
   ```

## üí° Pro Tips

Best practices to avoid common issues:

- **Restart Claude Desktop** after MCP config changes - this is the #1 fix for MCP issues
- **Keep API keys secure** and never commit them to version control
- **Use `npm run build`** after any TypeScript changes - don't forget!
- **Test with `quick` command** before full `run` to catch errors early
- **Check browser console** for frontend errors - press F12
- **Use absolute paths** in file operations to avoid path confusion
- **Validate JSON** before using as input - use `jq` or online validators
- **Read error messages** carefully - they often tell you exactly what's wrong
- **Check file permissions** if you get access denied errors
- **Keep dependencies updated** with `npm update`
