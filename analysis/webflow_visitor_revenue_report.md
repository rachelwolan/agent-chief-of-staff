## Strategic Insights

### 1. Geographic Opportunities
- **High Performer:** "Rest of world" markets demonstrate exceptional conversion rates (73.5%) with 662K visitors
- **Underperformer:** Europe shows 59.1% conversion despite 251K visitors - 14.4pp below average
- **Growth Potential:** NA market has room for expansion with moderate conversion (64.8%)

### 2. Channel Efficiency Paradox
- **High-Converting, Low-Volume:** Paid social (90.7% conv) and organic social (87.2% conv) drive <2% of traffic
- **Low-Converting, High-Volume:** Direct channel drives 45% of conversions but only 58% conversion rate
- **Optimization Target:** Direct channel in Europe (41.4% conversion) significantly underperforms

### 3. Revenue Concentration Risk

- **Value Disparity:** DXP customers generate 4x more MRR per customer than CMS ($129 vs $32)
- **Volume vs Value:** Website Builder has 118K customers but only 12% of MRR

### 4. Conversion Funnel Metrics
- **Overall Pre-Signup Rate:** 70.8% average across all channels
- **Best Channel Performance:** Paid social â†’ 90.7% conversion
- **Worst Channel Performance:** Direct â†’ 58.2% conversion
