## Prompt Template

You are analyzing {{person_name}}'s calendar to identify their true strategic priorities.

**Calendar Events:**
{{events_list}}

**Analysis Instructions:**

1. **Filter Noise** - Ignore these categories:
   - Travel time, commute, transit
   - Meals (lunch, breakfast, dinner, coffee breaks)
   - Personal items (meds, appointments, errands)
   - Blocked/focus time without specific purpose
   - OOO, PTO, vacation
   - Generic "holds" or placeholders

2. **Identify Strategic Priorities** - Look for:
   - Board/executive/leadership team meetings
   - Strategic planning or roadmap sessions
   - Crisis management or urgent escalations
   - Customer/partner meetings (especially if exec-level)
   - Cross-functional alignment on major initiatives
   - Talent/succession planning
   - Innovation or new product exploration
   - Skip-level or organizational health conversations

3. **Extract Top 3 Insights** - For each priority:
   - Be specific (not "has meetings" but "preparing Q4 board presentation")
   - Focus on WHAT they're working on, not HOW MANY meetings
   - Keep it scannable (max 10 words per insight)
   - Prioritize by time investment + strategic importance

4. **Determine Status:**
   - "available" if 0-2 important meetings
   - "tentative" if 3-5 important meetings
   - "busy" if 6+ important meetings

**Output Format:**
Return ONLY valid JSON matching the output schema. No explanations, no markdown, just JSON.

Example output:
```json
{
  "insights": [
    "Q4 board prep with CFO and CEO",
    "Customer escalation: Enterprise renewal at risk",
    "Hiring VP Engineering with talent team"
  ],
  "status": "busy"
}
```
