when you move to the other and it would like flip it out for some reason. I have no idea why they had such an interaction, but you know, they did. Yeah, well I think part of it is I was traveling yesterday and then I was like using my headphones to take calls and just like, I'm like, don't you know that I'm at home right now? Like, don't you have, exactly, I'm plugged into my monitor and like everything should just work, come on. You should use a big camera and yeah. It's like drivers, man, they're hard. Yeah, yeah, I'm just like friends. Everything about dealing with hardware and like kind of the base level is always hard. I was at Dropbox for four years before this and I can just tell you that what we had to build was very much not out of the box and was hard to maintain and was like kind of a, you know, the operating systems are out, it's always like a cat and mouse game. It is, it is. And then you have like two distinct, or three, I guess what Linux, you have three distinct philosophies on how the systems behave. It's like Windows are trying to be backwards compatible at all costs, but then that always has some weirdness of some sort and then Apple is always doing their thing. They sure are. It's great from the technology perspective, but when everybody always has to play catch up, I mean, it drives people like in your role crazy because like, come on, I don't want to go back and like revamp for your redone system architecture, even if it is better. I know, I know. And I'm also always like, when can I deprecate that? I'm like the grim reaper sometimes at companies where I'm like, this doesn't feel necessary and then you like think about removing something and then you figure out who is yelling and if you want to listen to them. Yeah, when I was at Wunderlist, I did a lot of work with the mobile teams and that was a constant battle between the Android and the iOS. Interesting. Of course, you know, the Android team was the underfunded one, but they had all the users, so. Yeah, I know. That's funny, right? Yep, so. Anyway. You joined from Dropbox, so how have you found Webflow to be? Yeah, it's a very different product to work on. Kind of a similar culture in some ways. We were fully remote, obviously, like much bigger company. We have a very different growth profile, which is great. I prefer being, you know, I would describe Dropbox, the best way, like in one line is, Dropbox was in its teenage years, really trying to figure out who it wanted to be when it was an adult. And I would say Webflow is in our pre-teen years. And there's just different problems that you encounter in companies that are, but I did that intentionally because I think it's more fun to work at a company that I think hasn't been kind of like, you have to go down this one road, but where we're still kind of forging that road. And so that's the best way that I can describe the types of problems that we end up kind of focusing on. They're a little more like existential in good ways. And where I think you have a lot of opportunity to shape path. Whereas when you're at a company where you're running a $2 billion plus P&L and that's 95% of your revenue and like, that's kind of what we did. And then, my job was to both run that core business, but also try to help it. Like I bought the company that basically became our Gen AI play. And, but that was like, again, going through that existential crisis much further down the road is a very different motion. It's a very different, it felt very foreign and they're still struggling to be quite honest. And so it's a lot, I think that it's been really refreshing to be at a company where it's like, hey, we can make a decision and then the next day we start working against that decision. You can make changes like, you may not be doing things exactly the way that you wanted to be doing things to begin with and that's okay. And I think it's also a little easier sometimes to operate in private, especially right now. Yeah, very much so. I mean, like at Shopify we really tried hard to maintain the ability to pivot and do things, but damn, at that scale, it was like you really, you really felt everything fighting against you if you let it, right? Totally. I mean, and for good reason. I mean, it's a big company now. It's powering a bunch of commerce. People rely on it. You can't move people's cheese too far, too fast. And yet, and yet there was all those times when we'd be like, well, couldn't we do something different? Totally, totally. And I still think that there's some of that happens here. I mean, we have, let's say, north of a, we have like 400,000 customers, somewhere in that range, like 350, 400, somewhere in there. And our, you know, like we've made that pivot into enterprise. And, you know, I think the biggest opportunity for us is like, how do we make sure that the core business just kind of keeps doing its thing? We're not disrupting it too much, but then obviously there's a lot of opportunities for us to improve things for different segments while not trying to disrupt other segments. Right. And with this whole AI thing shaking everything hard, it's- That's right. It's time for a thing, and it's funny because like, I'm sure you've wrestled with this at all, but obviously, like, from one perspective, like there's the whole group of people who are like, yes, AI is good, change the world and everything. And then there's the other perspective, which is like, it's all over value, it's a bubble. And you know, they're both kind of right and kind of wrong. But what I was really interested to see is how much of a bite it's already taking out of like the search engines. Yep. And how people find stuff online. And like, if there's like one big question I wanted to ask you, it's like, what are you, like I watched your presentation at the recent conference you did, and like really trying to think through, okay, how do you react to that? Because like, on the one hand, you can build websites like you always build. But on the other hand, like one of the things we were wrestling with at Shopify was like, how do we actually get into places where the customers are? Yep. Which, you know, the chatbots are one of them, the Facebooks are another, so. Yeah, I assume you're talking at our conference, because I just spoke at a conference yesterday. I assume you did not see that, okay? I'm just like, which talk did he actually see? Okay, good. I'm pretty sure that you weren't watching like the CloudFlare conference for, because I basically give a talk about this. Yeah, it was very interesting, actually. This was actually Matthew, CloudFlare's president, what he talked about on stage as well. And what I think is fascinating is that different brands want different things and want to interact differently with the, you know, let's call it the answer engine. Right. So, like, you have like a Conde Nast where your entire business is content and you want the LLMs to pay you for your content. You have a Reddit that's kind of similar, right, where you want the LLMs to pay you for your content because you're going to supply answers across like a wide variety, you know, then you have like brands, you know, like B2B brands. I would say vast majority of our business is B2B, definitely have a lot of B2C as well and e-commerce, but I would say 60, 20, 20, you know. And we have big brands in each of those categories that are on our platform, but let's take like a B2B brand. So, you're not actually that worried for the most part about your business getting taken over by like ChatGPT. That's a very different, you have a very different expectation about like how you want to interact with the LLM and you want to supply it answers. You're not even, you don't care that much about the transaction. You're like, can I get somebody to my front door? Can I get the qualified lead? Or can I even get the little snippet into the search? Well, that's like the beginning, that's the top. And then there's like the mid funnel consideration of, you know, all of the longer tail questions that somebody might ask as they're going through consideration. Because you don't usually just ask one question to an LLM, you ask 20, you know. So, you're like, how much can I feed and anticipate what somebody is going to ask as they're going through the evaluation process? And how do we then both provide the technical underpinning of that? How do we coach them? How do we have agents that are like, you know, effectively updating and pointing out content that's stale, where it's like out of date content on a head-to-head competitor, for example. Because they've gone and they've updated their product and you're not properly updated. So, and then like, you kind of can look at it and be like, well, where is this going? Do conversions eventually come off the page? Like if I look at what Shopify announced with OpenAI two weeks ago or a week and a half ago, the buy it button, like, I don't know, are you going to have a meet me button or whatever? And it will come, like that will happen. And that's really going to be our lot in life to ensure that we are full, they get to both have the ability to block, like you, of course, but if you block, you're not going to get crawled. You're not going to show up in those answer engines. And that also has, you have to decide, like what, pick your poison. It's like, so I think that's one piece. And then I think the second piece that we're really focused on is the middle funnel consideration, where maybe you want to have, you know, like a hosted pricing calculator that's like a chat GPT app that shows up or a meeting, you know, like a booking engine or a location lookup for, you know, like Orange Theory Fitness, because they don't care if you come to their website, but you will still have primary sources. Like, I don't believe that there's ever going to be a day when you don't have any primary source for a brand. No, no, in fact, I think, I mean, thesis point, I think you're always going to have to have that connection between each entity, whether it's a brand, it's a person, it's a band, it's a whatever it is, and the people that are connecting with, whether that's a customer, a band, whatever. And yeah, it's handy to have cloud or whatever name you want to put on chat GPT in your pocket, helping you connect and find them because they're great at that. They're great at like, understand, having a rough understanding of what you're trying to ask, but at some point you want them out of the way so you can just move on and have your interaction with the band or the, you know, whatever it is. Well, then it's like an experience. Right. So if you look at a website as an experience rather than it only providing information and only being there to convert, I think that like those are three different roles that a website plays, but actually I think you're gonna end up moving back more towards the experience side. Like, how do I have an emotional engagement with this brand? How do I feel after I, you know, encounter it? That's something I've long wondered about, like as we've been through the last couple of decades of the Google slash search engine, it adds the direct ad tech, whatever label you want to put on it. We've gotten so good at measuring conversion and so good at like hyper optimizing that. And like the bagging question in the back of my head is like, but what about that Halo stuff? What about that like story stuff? What about like the things that Coca-Cola does by putting their, Yeah. So you just see it as ambiently there so therefore you know it, and that still is unmeasurable. It's still barely... It is, that's right, that's right. How did you think about it at Shopify? I'm curious, I know it's been a minute since you, are you still there? No, you've been like a couple months. I took the summer off and spent time with the kid and I've got a nine year old and some family stuff and I was catching up and yeah. Where do you live? I live in Greece. Oh, wow, amazing. That's Leminki, Greece, which is up in the mainland. It's at the very top of the Aegean. So it's not like an island. When I say Greece, everybody immediately snaps to, oh, which island? It's like, no, not quite that awesome. How did you end up there? My wife, my wife is Greek and her family is. We lived in Berlin for a decade and that was great fun. And then the pandemic hit and her parents are younger than my parents and they were helping out a lot and they were here in Greece and you go through a pandemic thing and you're like, oh, well, maybe it's nice to have family around. And the other thing is we wanted to make sure Alex, our son, got enough of the Greek side of his culture because his mom's convinced that once he gets old enough, he's gonna be like us and out in the world and doing that. So we wanted to get a little bit of Greek. I mean, and so we've got a really good set up, like we're in a village outside of Thessaloniki and then 10 minutes down the hill is where his grandparents. Amazing. Oh, you're like living the dream. Yeah. So like, there's so many ways in which is suboptimal. Cause like, I can't get the latest Apple things delivered to me. Like, you know, Amazon, my closest to Amazon is Germany and, you know, also. Oh my God. So, you know, but, uh, but, uh, but we have that part set for a few years. We're good. Um, and I forgot to ask where are you? I was assuming Bay area. Yeah. Yeah. I live in Berkeley, Berkeley, California. I like it. Yeah. Have you lived out here before? I have, I lived in the Bay area for, for quite a while. Nice. Where, where were you? I was in Campbell and a mountain view in San Francisco for a while. And then I moved to Portland and I started dating somebody who lived in Berkeley, Berkeley, right by the Ashby station. And so like I was, I had moved away from the Bay area and ended up spending like halftime for another five years in the East Bay. Yeah. That's awesome. Yeah. I missed it. It's, it's, it's the one place where, um, when I, when I look down at an airplane, when you're coming in, it's like, Oh, I know where I am. I know where we're going. I know everything that this is. Yeah. All the bad things you can say about California and all the bad things you can say about the Bay area. It's still like, it gets me right here. Yeah, I feel like I've just kind of glossed over the bad things at this point and I've just kind of accepted it. Um, but yeah. You gotta, you gotta love one. Anyway, anyway, we were talking, uh, Shopify. So how do we, how do we think about this? You know, it's a very, it was a very open ended question because like as soon as it became clear that the vendors were going to start locking down cookies in response to regulatory pressures and that the third party cookie tracking was going to get harder, um, there was an overall thesis that as important as the website is for telling the story of a merchant, you, you had to do a lot, or we were going to have to let help merchants do a lot more work to connect to people in other places. And, um, you know, there's a real, there was a real recognition that they need to help more with the SEO side, but as AI started showing up as like a huge recognition that, that we were going to have to play a different game. And that's one of the reasons why, um, the conversation started happening a long time ago and used to push lead to the announcement a couple of weeks ago. Yeah, I got to, I mean, I was, I was there when that all started. And that was a, that was a very interesting thing. So basically it's like, um, obviously it's unknown what particular thing is going to land, but the working theory is that we've got to play at basically multiple levels. And we, I say, we, it's not, we're not, we anymore, but, um, the Shopify had to be able to play at multiple levels in order to make sure to spread the bets and be in the right places at the right time. Um, for sure. Getting the, um, for a little while we were like, you know, do we need to actually do something to inject data for training into, into, into the, um, into the search engines and then into the agents. And then we realized, no, the agents would get really good at being able to access things and pull things in. So then how do we structure our websites in order to make them ingestible by, uh, the bots? And there it's, um, kind of two levels. One of which is the explicit integration that is what's being announced. It's like, how do you get enough information in a, in a good enough form that when the bot figures out, Oh, he's asking for a pair of shoes that are white and maybe sport shoes. How do I, how do I issue a search against the, the, all the short Shopify merchants out there and get a catalog. And that was that right there really blew our mind because of a reason I'll get to in a minute. And then the second was, how do we make sure that, um, even further that when it's not an explicit API call, when it's not an explicit call, how do we make sure to get general ambientness, I don't know what a better term for it, but ambient awareness of, of, of what the merchants are doing into, into the bot. So the bots know where to go to, to pick this stuff up. So, so let me just clarify one thing you said. So you said, if a bot is asking for white shoes, would they not be asking for it from a merchant? Would they be asking for it from Shopify or would they be asking? Yeah. Yeah. Um, entity is stuck in steps with shop. So like, okay, how do we, how do we provide a layer across merchants? But because there's this 20 year history of Shopify billing or for merchants in silo, it's not like merchants adopted into that game. Yeah. It was, uh, pale battle to do that. But we realized like we had the holy moment that, um, that whether or not we, we, we liked it, the, the, I'm not going to say moral position, but the, the, the, the worldview that we had where each shot could be totally independent of each other had just ended and we're going to have to be able to with, with AI, with the LMS, because, um, because at that point it's no longer a game of everybody playing SEO and trying to get their ratings up and searching is really about how you make API access work and work to everybody's effect, everybody's benefit through that. And, um, and so that started off a massive project to go actually figure out how to do that and unify that, that hit on several areas, one of which was technical, but the other, which was very much a product. How do we, how do we get merchants stopped in to this? How do we, how do we make it to where it's something that they desire to be part of basically a bigger marketplace? Because now on the downside, they're competing with everybody else, but on the upside, they can get into the search engine or the answer engines. I'm still not used to that term. It's still like, it's the best one I've heard so far, but it's still, it's the one that's like semi sticking, you know? Yeah. Um, and I think, I think Shopify is going to be wrestling with that for, for quite time. Um, we had made some moves beforehand that made that a little bit easier when we were looking at how do we, how do we get merchants better integrated with Facebook and Instagram and, and, and, um, those kinds of, of channels, um, you know, Instagram was probably the best implemented of, of all of them in terms of like, you get an ad that shows up in your Instagram feed and you get a little buy now button and that's like the first place where I've really, I've found so many neat and nifty things through Instagram and bought it through that. Um, so how do you, how do you really, um, get merchants to set up their data in their catalogs and to go in and connect up with these, um, systems and these connectors and to go even further and say, okay, how do we, how do we actually look for some kind of thing that helps us place those ads for, um, the merchants? And that, that was, that was where we were before AI happened. And then AI happened and I was like, okay, now we gotta go this whole, whole new level, which of course had all sorts of massive, um, technology impacts. So let me like play this back. You put together like the initial version of this buy it now button for Facebook, Instagram at the merchant level, and they got to opt in and decide, and you probably had integrations and whatever, and different, you know, whatever different partners went and build stuff. And that was, that was how you got integrated into that ecosystem. Then you had some of that infrastructure in place and, and were you able to like, kind of take that and put like a layer above it that was like a super API and like, how did you think about that problem? Yeah. So, um, even before AI, we were looking at how do we, the next step we wanted to take after, you know, being able to say to a merchant, yes, you can connect to Facebook and you can, you can, you can expose your catalog to it and then help, help provide enough data for the ads to get placed and all of that. Our next one was the, the next step was to actually go ahead and start bundling multiple people together in some sort of API that could be done. Um, so essentially make like the best term, again, this is separate from a terminology problem because it wasn't really a marketplace from the other side. I mean, your product, if it gets chosen, shows up in the ad stream and if people hit buy now, then they buy now. And if they don't, they don't. But, um, but it's best term to use from the conceptual. Yeah. Um, and so then, then it was the realization that, okay, this wasn't going to, this wasn't going to work on a, on a, on a one Z, two Z merchant by merchant basis, because if we let the merchants move at their own pace, um, A, they would be not in a good position to drive that change themselves and B, Shopify would miss out on all the sales that that would happen. And that, that was a problem for Shopify business model being tied to, um, type their percentage of the GMB at the sales. You know, it's, it was, that business model was great because it almost always put Shopify on the same side of the table as the customers, um, and all these interactions, but it also did really highlight that Shopify's continued success would be based on like, okay, how do we actually really get everybody more quickly and more, more, more, more firmly into where they need to be. And so, um, that launched off several, we, we drove several initiatives out of that first was getting to a unified taxonomy that we could actually publish out to the world and say, okay, this, this is a take on how you describe products in a taxonomy across the whole range of things that we see. And then the second was, how do you go through a customer's or merchant's product catalog and map what they have into that taxonomy and make suggestions and then help the customers, help the merchants get, get into that taxonomy. And then third was actually, um, aggregating the databases so you could do the lookups across it because the benefit, the massive benefit of treating each merchant's data separate is that became our scale unit and for databases. Right. That's how we started out the databases by merchant. All of a sudden we need to treat things as a global namespace and they're still, they're still wrestling with that at Shopify right now. That's, that's going to be a, a big, a big problem for, for quite some time. But, um, the global database across all of the, I can imagine that's a very difficult technical problem to be able to like index any change that happens basically in real time across, I don't know how many merchants you had, but I'm guessing millions and millions, billions, millions. Yeah. I'm like, Oh, that would be a lot. Um, it was like 1.2 billion websites, something like that. No, no. We had millions of merchants and, um, and that meant we had, um, basically thousands of distinct databases. And so, um, you know, they were all my SQL and what that meant to do. Anything that we wanted to do against the answer engines was going to require us to do a fan out query against all the databases and pull it back in. Yeah. That was a, um, no, no point of situation. How did, how did you think about, okay. So product partner comes to you and says, we want to do X. We want, we want to be able to search across all of the vendors that for the white shoes, like, how did you think about breaking down such a ambiguous problem and working across so many different teams and like different clock speeds across those teams and summer product products, summer platform, you're trying to align all these like people, like, how did you think about a problem like that? And you can maybe, maybe there's like a less, maybe there's a more tractable problem that you actually solved. Um, but yeah, so, so we, basically it was, how do we break the problem down so that we can go from current state to desired state? Um, one of the phrases that we use a lot was, you know, what is our desired state? Uh, this, no, I'm sorry. One of the phrases we use a lot was desired state thinking. I, what is it that we, how is it that we want the world to be? And then how do we get there and in the right number of steps to get there? And so, um, obviously, uh, you know, the, the, the, the correct answer here or desired state is everything's in one name space and you have infinitely available, um, massive, uh, massive databases everywhere. And of course these, this would be rather ridiculous to think about except Google actually did that with spam. And so then the question is, okay. Um, well, if we need to migrate from databases, well, what databases are we going to actually use so that we, that launched off one effort is going from, okay, what are we going to do for my SQL to whatever comes next? Um, are we going to, um, mesh them all with the tests? Are we going to, um, jump technologies and, you know, go into, into something like Spanner or are we actually going to go from hosting our own database? to hosting it with Google and making Google even more tempted to rent-seek on us. Spam was actually the correct technical decision, but it was the worst decision from the perspective of our sovereignty. And so then, OK, what do we do then? So that all goes off in a process of projects that are probably going to take two to three years to actually run through, and they're still in progress. Did you have your own cloud? No, no. We were running on Google Cloud. On Google Cloud. But Starfire used to have their own machines, and then they jumped to Google so they could handle BFCM. Got it. Because there was no way to keep buying hardware to be ready for BFCM. In fact, we had to really establish a great partnership with Google so that they could buy enough machines and stuff in the data centers at the right time so we'd be ready for it. Got it. But then we had to come back to, OK, product is asking for this. How do we get some semblance of ability to work this problem even before we complete the two- to three-year process of moving databases? And that's where we went back and said, OK, product, we can actually give you a view if you're willing to accept some latency in the data being put together. We already are pulling in all the databases into a unified view we're running analytics on. We have a new data lake that we're doing with. Can we actually tap into that and give you a read-only view that can do some of this, some of what you want so you can actually start then tinkering with the ideas and proving things out, even if we can't support everything that we want to do 100% on day one? Interesting. And so it was using the desired state technique. It was like, what do we need to do in order to get to that? And then rewinding, what steps can we take to get to that? And how can we, I almost want to say, fake it in such a way where a product can actually get enough experience with what they're thinking in order to validate whether or not what they're thinking is a good idea? Because even if we can't give them what they need to push out a feature today, we know where we're going. But we also know that if a product comes back and says, oh, yeah, we tried it. We prototyped it with the hack you gave us. And nope, that's not going to work. What we need is x. That would also be valuable data. Got it. So what you did was you gave them a read-only view that was just a view on top of your data warehouse that had some latency. And then they went and prototyped some very unleaded version of the product to see if they could get signal with a semi-painted door. And it turned out that even though product updates and catalogs would only happen once a day in that case, that was still pretty damn good for a lot of purposes. So this was, I'm sure this is what is somewhere underneath the stuff that is showing up in OpenAI's integration right now, is that they were able to materialize a view that helps that work in a read-only fashion. And then as soon as you actually get to the nice part there is as soon as you actually get to the product or the merchant that has the products, then you can go back to direct API access and you don't have to use the unified view. You can actually get the updated information right away. So the one hitch to that is it'll take a little bit of time for your new products or product changes to propagate through. But as soon as you get focused on something, then you're back into the realm where we can be real time. Yeah. That makes a ton of sense. The act of working through those products was very much targeted towards those kinds of maneuvers. It's the same kind of thing that we did when I first got to Shopify and headless was all the rage. And everybody was screaming at Shopify saying, you don't have a headless solution. And we were like, well, headless is interesting and there are people doing it well. And yet we have a dedicated solution, but we need something that fits the bill here. And if we build our own little thing, then that will actually help us make sure that we're well loved for all the other people who are actually doing headless solutions on whatever platform they happen to be. Yeah. That's where Hydrogen came in to play, which is basically the headless stuff that Shopify shipped a few years ago. Definitely familiar with it. That was kind of the same bootstrapping approach. It's like, OK, how do we do this? And that was solidly enough. That was Toby and I sitting in his office banging on keyboards doing the first prototypes. And then we handed it off and really worked with the multi-product teams and the engineering teams to get that to reality. And then it's like, oh, we need to host this somewhere. We can't just let some number of people who aren't going to want to host this stuff have a discussion. Oh, to go with Hydrogen, we need something like Oxygen, which is, and then we'll run out of time for our workers. And that took on a life of its own. And then we got it out there and it did exactly what it needed to do, which was build a hole in the offering, but it's not a raging success in terms of numbers of people who use it. The people who use it are doing very specialized things and they love it for that. But it's no different than your customers who are doing the same thing with what we're doing. So that's why. Makes sense. I want to give you time to ask me questions. Yeah, I was like, it's 240. I want to give you some time. Yeah, how are you doing? Do you have hard stuff? No, I'm OK. I'm OK. I guess the big questions I have for you on the product front is A, the AI stuff, but B, then I guess the e-commerce stuff is the part that I know the most about. Because, of course, recent history, and yet I see where you all are at and how it's going. But then I also watch what Stripe is doing with their primitives, and I'm really curious what you're thinking in the e-commerce space. Sure, that one's easier and maybe shorter, and then I can explain the AI stuff, which is everything. Yeah. So for e-commerce, we have a very, I would say, immature solution that is heavily under-invested in right now. And we almost deprecated this year. And then we decided to not deprecate it because we decided that we think an opportunity for us is to go open up and be the headed solution for larger companies where they don't necessarily want to have full-time developers working on oxygen. And where you already have a design system, we already have SEO and AEO capabilities, we've really built out a platform for building these types of experiences. And we're like, we don't know. You will still want to CMS, and you may also, but we don't want to be the merchant of record. That's just not something that is with it. We don't have the capacity to do that. So we will eventually, end of life, our existing e-commerce solution in favor of this. We just decided to give it a year. We're in the middle of building out an e-commerce team, and then we'll have first-party integrations. We have a bunch of integrations already in our ecosystem, and then we'll have first-party integrations that are really built for larger customers and agencies to go and use. So that's, to me, and then a lot of the places where I think we have opportunity are really around experience, around optimization, where we have a really strong solution, and then being able to go and create generative experiences inside of different engines. So that's gonna be a big part of the strategy, but that's probably gonna come a little bit later. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense, and it's like, if I were in your shoes just not knowing everything, obviously, but with my own biases, it's like, how do you make sure that the CMS gets everything it needs, because that's something that a Shopify doesn't do well, or whatever, and how do you connect to Shopify? How do you connect to whatever Stripe is doing for product catalogs? Exactly. And really just focus on the CMS, because I'll play with the product, and the CMS is there, and it has so much potential, and there's a lot that can be done there, obviously, that would be really good. So let me skip the AI question, because that can get us into a lot of theory, and it's not necessarily directly related to the conversation. Something more direct is, what challenges do you run into with technology? You kind of got at that with the bulk of your question, of how does technology and product work together, from my perspective, but where are you finding the pain spots? I mean, I think that this is, so, okay, we can talk about different places in which this role would overlap with the pain. I mean, just quite frankly, I don't think we have a long-term point of view yet on, like, let's say I wanted to be five nines. Let's say I wanted to be six nines, you know, 100%, and give that kind of guarantee. What would we have to do to work backwards from that? I'm not saying tomorrow, but I don't think that we have the point of view in what that working backwards approach would look like, and then thinking about what would have to be true. And I do think there are going to be customers that are, as we get larger and larger, and go after larger and larger customers, that will require us to sign up for that. So I would say that's like, first I'd like us to hit four nines, of course, like, consistently. That would just be, you know, not a hope, but like, the absolute bare minimum. So that's maybe one. I think the second is, we very much, I think, have desired to be more than just a website platform, but are still very reliant on a lot of the technology that is just kind of the part and parcel of us being a website platform. And, you know, I think that really thinking through what is our strategy if we want to have a true cloud, and where is our differentiation on top of that versus what Cloudflare is providing, for example. Where it- It's between you and Cloudflare. Exactly, and I do think a big part of what we do is provisioning, and making that dead simple, making sure that we've picked the right providers, we have the right telemetry in place, like, we understand how to actually manage, be a managed host. Like, that is half the value we provide, at least. And that should be true for every single thing that we deliver, right? And so we have a very nascent cloud solution in the world where we have a lot to think about in order to even take some of the things that we've built internally and make those available to our customers. So I think that that's oftentimes what I think about, is like, what are we using internally that is part of our own provisioning that we could then go take and make available to our customers? And so having like a really clear perspective on what that innovation pipeline looks like because part of our value prop is hosting, a big part of our value prop. And again, it's like gotta be bulletproof, and so there's the, like, just the basics, like, nail the brilliant basics. That if that was the only thing we did and we didn't get to the second one, I would probably be okay with that. I would probably be okay with that. It would be a different business. I think it's kind of essential for our business. But I'd probably be okay. That matches in with where I would mentally map you or the company at is a place where it's like, okay, first off, needs to tighten the bolts down. Trust, I call it trust. Yeah, trust has to be there. Yeah, and it's trust in so many different places because I would say you would intersect with me a lot. I run our data science and data plot, like, analytics engineering, like, we're the largest consumer of the data plot, right? And we do not trust the data plot. And so when you don't trust the data plot, everything, you just spend so much time trying to unwind the data plot. And I think it's gotten better this year. We actually have made a lot of improvements. But part of it is we don't trust the providers all the time. Like, we're halfway through move-off click house. We don't trust. And then they did their managed hosts and they did some funky stuff duplicating data. And then it like, I'll just give you an example. And it like threw off our forecast and then, you know, we're back. And like, like, you know, for one of the pricing and packaging initiatives. And then it just is like, you got to trust your data. It's got to be like, and we didn't even catch it for like three or four months after. And I was like, so that to me is like, how do we, I want to get to trust. Like, I want to just, and that's part of, I think, being a preteen company. We can have all these aspirations to be a teenager or an adult, but I think that the preteen company just, you just need to trust. Like, yeah. Does that make sense? Yeah, totally. I mean, even, even if the size of Shopify was, we, we, we got to the point where there was parts of the data platform that we weren't trusting. And it was super scary. It's really scary when you don't. Um, and I think the other thing for us is it's also, we use the same data plat for our customers. So we have data products that are running on that data plat. And if our customers stop trusting us, they're just going to churn. Which is the right thing to do. You don't want two data platforms. You don't want to have two different things, but at the same time, it's all good. It's, it's gotta be verifiable and, um, and testable. Exactly. When, when these things tickle the site from the outside world, then I see these counters go somewhere. Delta's happened in other places and the cascade happens. Yeah. Yeah. And that was super important. And then, I mean, maybe like, I think that there's always in this role going to be a question of like, maybe this is also part of trust, but like, do we trust what we're releasing? Are people like following good hygiene? Are they like documenting, you know, when we have a Sev and we do like a, whatever, you know, like it's, I just see as not doing the things that we need to do. And, you know, like there's accountability of like, Hey, if you have, like, you have to learn from these things. Um, and I'm really looking for a partner here that can help mature our organization that way. And I think there's, you know, you've, you're kind of in the middle of like some people who have kind of always done this way, including founders. That's not necessarily a problem anymore. I feel like we've kind of moved on from that problem, but there's still a lot of like, well, I can't, I can't release this quickly. And I'm like, okay, you should have thought ahead about the five things you need to do. And, or, or maybe we try to automate more and more of this with AI. Like to me, this is like probably not, there's it. The question that I have in terms of like developer efficiency is going to be like, well, what part is the developer still responsible for and what parts are they less responsible for? Because they at least have like a companion, uh, like that. They still have to be accountable. They still have to take responsibility. Exactly. They have to be able to understand that the thing is, that they're using AI as a partner, that it's a buzzy partner, and they still have to be able to put in the constraints that actually give you verifiable, provable things. And then part of it is getting the discipline to be able to release things in a way that if what you release breaks, it's that thing that breaks and not the whole system. Well, it's that thing that breaks and you have observability and you can like actually like get your mean time to resolution down and, and be able to build things in a way that where you have graceful degradation. Sure. That too, for sure. Because like if, if, if I'm shipping a new feature, most features are going to be, um, are going to be evolutions of existing things. And so like how do you, how do you make sure that you're working in a stepwise fashion so that you've broken each migration from one version of the feature to another in such a way that a, you can do each step of the way in a safe way, but B if it turns out not to be safe, it's still not deadly. And you can step your way back and take a breath and, and then move forward again. Um, and that's, and that's just, there's no amount of automation that'll, that'll help. That's, that's human discipline. That's right. That's the humans knowing that when I do this, I mean, I'm responsible for these checklist items and, um, and, and, and to take as many of those items out as we can. But, you know, in the same way that airplanes got to where they are because, you know, the, the, the relentless, um, the relentless digging into everything that breaks and having, having really good process around where you need it. Um, and you know, most engineers are naturally a little anti-process it's kind of, you have to, you have to figure out where you need to be that maniacally methodical and where you can let off and where the creativity can come from. It's the same, you know, it's the same, um, same with so many things, but like the constraints there have to be seen as useful constraints that are, that everybody buys into and that people acknowledge are important and they understand why it's important. Even when you don't like double checking your doors to see if they're locked before. That's right. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Some of the examples I use in these conversations are actually really rather dry examples. It's like, do you like checking the tire, the tire pressure on your car? Yeah, no, I like, I like that example. And, and I think that that's the, I call it eating our broccoli. We've got to eat our broccoli cause got to like, you know, get some of the bad stuff out that is just been maybe backed up a little bit continue with this bad analogy. That's right. And part of it is the broccoli analogy is really good because the other thing I was going to say is, is making sure the humans who are on this aren't also killed by the broccoli. Right. How do you make broccoli palatable? How do you make it palatable? You can have really bad broccoli. You can have, I've had the best broccoli in the world. You put a little brown butter, a little bit of lemon. It's amazing. And then how do you make sure that people eating the broccoli are still getting in their Sunday cheats and they're going and eating ice cream too? Exactly. And so part of the human factor of this is, is how do you get people where they get really regimented in one aspect, but you do, you don't require them to be that regimented all the time. Right. Make sure that you cycle folks in such a way that you don't, in such a way that, that they can do the stuff that's wrote because the back of their brain can be working on what they're going to be doing for whatever it is. Yeah. Right. Where does the creativity get unleashed? Totally. You know, it's like, it's like the, when I think of drug work, you know, I, I, I'm not a big military guy, but I think of military work like when you're on a ship and you're like, you're the cook. Yeah. It's like, there's so much of that job that's just like the same day in, day out. Yeah. How do you, how do you keep the person motivated to do a great job at that? And, and part of that is how do you, how do you help them get out of their lane just enough that the rest of it, they're like, yeah, this is my job. I can take pride in my job and I get to play it and I take pride in my job and I make sure that I hit these numbers. And part of this is, I think sadly, I used the airplane analogy earlier, but sadly there's something weird going on in the industry or with people when we talk about like blameless incidents and blameless culture. Yeah. Because you need us, you need an amount of that where somebody is not knows that they're not going to lose their job if they made an error, that is a reasonable error to have made and just needs to be corrected. Right. You can't, you don't want your people covering up. You don't want people, you know, doing all these things. So blameless though, seems to have been taken into the direction of, well, we don't name names and we don't, we don't, we don't take responsibility and accountability. It just happens. You know, yeah. Yeah. It's like I made this decision and this happened. Like there's a, you know, I think that like every exec we have to, we make certain decisions and when they don't go right, if you don't take responsibility for that, that's probably even worse than at least being like, Hey, I should have done this differently. Yeah. My favorite, my favorite, one of my favorite illustrations of this is the iPhone leak. You know, the guy who left his iPhone out at the bar a long time ago. Oh yeah. I remember this. Steve Jobs went up with it. Everybody assumes that guy got fired. He didn't. Right. Yeah. He got to talk to Steve. He gets, he got to talk to a lot of people, confident that he knew what had happened and they got the information they needed from him and they had the conversation. Yes. He wasn't allowed to carry secret devices off campus. Right. But it was his job, but he had to take accountability for it. And he had to be able to, to, to, to, to show up and help fix the problem that was created. Yeah. And I think there's a, there's a really weird thing happening in a lot of infra related teams where they haven't quite figured out the right balance of that. How do you, how do you, how do you not make it a blame issue, but it is an accountability issue. And how do you make people responsible for understanding what happened and what, what's going to happen, what's going to happen to fix it. And how to take that from a net negative place of you screwed up. So therefore you suck, which is, yeah. To we screwed up. You were in a hot seat. We're going to fix it so that the next time you're in a hot seat, you're not going to get trapped by that again. Yep. Yep. Yep. Totally agree with that. Cool.  that was really helpful to hear how you thought about those areas. And, you know, obviously this is to me, it just, just so you kind of understand my framing, like there's a bunch of things that are product priorities. They always come below, like in the, we do a stack rank. Alan and I just literally released the stack rank or the initial stack rank for the next six weeks today. Right. And at the top is always availability, reliability, security, stability. Right. Like that is like, what are the things that, but I think that right now it's very like incremental of like, and I'm not, I think that there's opportunities for us to like kind of get to that North star of what we're trying to accomplish. We've also just made some changes on the product side as well for product partners in these areas because we're like, we're hiring a new director in this area. And like, I think that we are just the place where we can't be kids about it anymore. We have to at least be preteens and, you know, our customers are adults. And so it's like, we just had to make sure we're kind of like matching their level of security and the trust that they're putting in us. I mean, that's really good to hear because it is, it is a, it requires a partnership between everybody in order to make that work. Right. Yeah. I've seen product teams that push hard and be like, you know, I don't care what you have to do to ship it. It's like, well, are you sure you want that? Yeah. Whereas the right thing is somewhere in between, which is like, yes, we need this. Yes. This is important to customers. Yes. This is a priority. We got to get the ship and it's got to ship. It's got to not fall down. Right. It's got to, because if you ship the busted thing, that's worse than it's worse. And I think we're at that point where we are like, I think we were probably in the, like just ship it mode for a long time. And we were at that point where we're like, okay, got it. Got to eat a broccoli. Yep. And to be fair, there's probably a big chunk of the history of the company where that was the right reflex. That's right. Right. Um, and, and that's part of the, the, um, the message and the internalization that has to happen, but with everybody is that, yeah, sure. Things were this way and that's fine for that point in history. That's right. Now, this point in history. And so therefore, yes, we got to eat our broccoli. We got to study for our driver's license test. We got to, we got to, we got to make sure that we can take the driver's license test, which means we got to put the homework in, which means that the, the, the, the right. Yeah. Not to skip analogies to something else. Yeah. Totally. Um, well I do have a hard stop now. now. But I really enjoyed chatting with you and I learned a lot in this conversation. I appreciate that. I did too, and it's really hard to do a discussion like this and collapse it into an hour and try to like explore the space of everything with the right set of questions and how it goes. Yeah. I think I think I think I'd give us good marks for an hour's worth of that. I think so. I feel like we've made up some good ground here. I could probably I would like to sit and have a very long, detailed discussion with you at some point in the near future. I mean, and and I do have a good answer for the question, by the way, I wasn't trying to dodge it. We have a very clear strategy that I'm now I'm more than happy to have a discussion about that. I didn't I didn't want to. It's exciting. Obviously, first order of business, if this pans out, is that we sit down and spend a lot of time. Yeah, but even before, you know, as if this works out like I'm happy to spend more time with you is what I'm trying to say. Awesome. Hey, really, really good to meet you. And yeah, have a great evening. It's probably like very late there. Thanks. Thanks for taking a late call with me. I appreciate it. All right. All right. Take care. Bye.
