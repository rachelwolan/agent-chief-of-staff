## üí° STRATEGIC SOUNDBITES BY TOPIC

### Topic 1: What Product Managers Need to Learn to Be Relevant in the Age of AI

#### Core Soundbites

**1. "The shift from 'build mode' to 'orchestration mode'"**
- "We're moving from PMs who build features to PMs who orchestrate AI agents. It's like going from being a carpenter to being an architect - you still need to understand construction, but your value comes from designing the system, not hammering the nails."

**2. "Answer Engine Optimization is the new SEO"**
- "If your product isn't optimized for AI discovery, you're invisible to half your potential users. At Webflow, we realized that Answer Engine Optimization isn't just about being found - it's about being recommended by AI as the solution."

**3. "The learn-it-all beats the know-it-all, every time"**
- "The PMs who thrive aren't the ones who know everything about AI - they're the ones who experiment daily. I spend 30 minutes every morning with Claude Code or Gumloop, not because I need to ship code, but because I need to understand what's possible."

**4. "Distribution-first PM thinking"**
- "Stop asking 'what should we build?' Start asking 'how will AI recommend us?' Every feature decision at Webflow now includes an AEO score - will this make us more discoverable and recommendable by AI systems?"

#### Supporting Stories

**Story 1: The Wake-Up Call**
"Six months ago, I watched a junior engineer use Claude to build in 2 hours what would have taken our team 2 weeks. That's when I realized - if we're not leveraging AI agents, we're not just slow, we're obsolete. We immediately shifted our entire product org to what I call 'agent-first development.'"

**Story 2: The 10x PM**
"I have a PM on my team who went from managing one product to effectively managing three - not by working harder, but by automating 70% of their operational work with AI agents. They use Relay.app for stakeholder updates, Claude for PRD writing, and Gumloop for data analysis. They're not 10x faster; they're 10x more strategic."

### Topic 2: How I Transitioned Webflow's Product Suite from AI-Enabled to AI-Native

#### Core Soundbites

**1. "AI-enabled adds features; AI-native changes the game"**
- "AI-enabled means you sprinkled some ChatGPT on top. AI-native means AI is the foundation. We rebuilt Webflow so that AI doesn't just help you design - it ships production-ready code. That's the difference between a toy and a tool."

**2. "From 'vibe coding' to 'prompt-to-production'"**
- "Everyone's doing 'vibe coding' - throwing prompts at AI and hoping for magic. We built prompt-to-production - where AI understands your design system, respects your constraints, and delivers code that's actually shippable, not just impressive."

**3. "The three-pillar transformation"**
- "We transformed Webflow through three pillars: AI generation (building apps from prompts), AI optimization (AEO and SEO for both humans and machines), and AI assistance (contextual help that knows your entire codebase). One pillar is a feature; three pillars is a platform."

**4. "Production-grade or playground - pick one"**
- "Most AI tools create beautiful prototypes that you have to rebuild from scratch. We asked: what if AI could generate code so good, you'd ship it to production? That question drove our entire AI-native transformation."

#### Supporting Stories

**Story 1: The Customer Moment**
"A customer showed me their workflow: generate in MidJourney, prototype in Figma, rebuild in Webflow, optimize manually. Six tools, two weeks. I asked my team: 'What if they could do all of this in Webflow in one day?' That became our North Star for AI-native development."

**Story 2: The Internal Dogfooding Success**
"We used our own AI platform to rebuild our pricing page. What usually takes 3 sprints took 3 days. But here's the kicker - the AI-generated version converted 23% better because it was automatically optimized for Answer Engines. That's when we knew we had something special."

### Topic 3: What Each Product Leader Can Do to Ensure Their Product and Team Are Competitive

#### Core Soundbites

**1. "Build your AI council, not your AI strategy"**
- "Don't start with strategy; start with people. Create an AI council of your most curious team members - not necessarily the most senior. Give them Friday afternoons to experiment. Their discoveries will shape your strategy better than any McKinsey deck."

**2. "Measure AI readiness, not AI adoption"**
- "Everyone measures how many people use AI. We measure how ready our product is to be discovered, recommended, and integrated by AI. That's a fundamental shift from user metrics to AI ecosystem metrics."

**3. "The 70-20-10 rule for AI transformation"**
- "70% of your effort should be automating existing workflows with AI, 20% should be enhancing current features with AI capabilities, and 10% should be moonshot AI-native innovations. Most companies do this backwards and wonder why they fail."

**4. "Hire for AI curiosity, train for AI capability"**
- "I don't hire PMs who know AI; I hire PMs who can't stop experimenting with it. You can teach someone to write prompts. You can't teach someone to be perpetually curious about what's possible."

#### Supporting Stories

**Story 1: The Team Transformation**
"I gave every PM $500 and one mandate: spend this on AI tools and show us what you learned. One PM automated our entire competitive intelligence gathering. Another built a customer feedback analysis system. The ROI wasn't the tools they bought - it was the mindset shift from consumers to creators of AI solutions."

**Story 2: The Metrics Revolution**
"We stopped asking 'How many users?' and started asking 'How many AI recommendations?' When Perplexity started recommending Webflow 10x more often, we knew our AEO strategy was working. That metric shift changed every product decision we made."

## ‚ùì QUESTIONS TO ASK JAY

### Strategic Questions (Position as Expert)

1. **On Community Learning**: "With Product Coalition's massive reach, what patterns are you seeing in how the most successful PMs are adapting to AI - not just using it, but fundamentally rethinking their role?"

2. **On Future Skills**: "You've built this incredible community over 10 years - if you were starting Product Coalition today in the AI era, what would you do differently to prepare PMs for what's coming in 2026 and beyond?"

3. **On Industry Evolution**: "You mentioned in your 'Bigger Questions' series that advantage belongs to those who frame the sharpest questions. What's the sharpest question you think PMs should be asking themselves about AI that they're currently missing?"

### Engaging Questions (Show Interest)

1. **On Podcast Evolution**: "How has your approach to these conversations evolved as AI has become more central to product management? Are you finding guests are bringing different perspectives than even six months ago?"

2. **On Community Insights**: "What's the most surprising thing your 7,000 Slack members have taught you about how AI is actually being used in product orgs versus how we think it should be used?"

## üéØ POTENTIAL CURVEBALLS & RESPONSES

### Q: "Isn't AI just hype? How do we know this isn't another crypto/metaverse moment?"

**Response**: "Great question. The difference is adoption velocity and practical value. At Webflow, we're seeing customers reduce development time by 75% - that's not hype, that's measurable ROI. When our AI-generated pages convert 23% better than human-designed ones, that's not speculation, that's data. The question isn't whether AI is real - it's whether your product will be competitive without it."

### Q: "How do you handle the fear that AI will replace PMs?"

**Response**: "AI doesn't replace PMs; it replaces PMs who don't use AI. It's like saying Excel replaced accountants - it didn't, it made them exponentially more valuable. At Webflow, our PMs who embraced AI agents now handle 3x the scope with better outcomes. They're not worried about being replaced; they're excited about their multiplied impact."

### Q: "What about companies that can't afford massive AI investments?"

**Response**: "This is exactly why the 'learn-it-all' approach works. You don't need a million-dollar AI budget. Start with $50/month for Claude or ChatGPT Team licenses. Give your team Friday afternoons to experiment. We found that our best AI innovations came from individual PMs with $30 tool subscriptions, not from our enterprise AI initiatives."

### Q: "How do you measure the success of AI-native transformation?"

**Response**: "Three metrics matter: Time to Production (how fast can you go from idea to shipped feature?), AI Discovery Rate (how often are you recommended by AI systems?), and Team Leverage Ratio (how much more can each person accomplish?). At Webflow, we've improved all three by over 200% in the last year."

### Q: "What's your biggest AI implementation failure?"

**Response**: "We tried to go too big too fast initially. We wanted to AI-enable everything simultaneously. Total disaster. We learned to follow the 70-20-10 rule - focus mostly on automating existing workflows first. Our biggest win came from the smallest start - using AI to write better PR FAQs. That simple success created believers who drove bigger changes."

### The Call to Action
"Start small, but start today. Pick one workflow, automate it with AI. Pick one feature, optimize it for Answer Engines. Pick one team member, make them your AI champion. The gap between AI-native and AI-curious companies is growing every day."

### The Webflow Vision
"At Webflow, we believe the best products aren't just built with AI - they're built for an AI-mediated world. That's why everything we do assumes that both humans and machines need to understand, discover, and recommend our platform."
