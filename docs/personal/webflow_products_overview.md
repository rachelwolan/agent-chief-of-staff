Webflow is a comprehensive **website experience platform** that spans visual design, content management, ecommerce, hosting, collaboration, and developer extensibility. Below, we break down Webflow’s core products and experimental tools — including each product’s **job-to-be-done (JTBD)**, its target **user segments**, a **persona example** illustrating its value, and **competitive positioning** with pricing insights.

## Core Platform

### Webflow Designer (Visual Development Tool)
**JTBD:** Empower designers to build custom, responsive websites visually without coding, while outputting clean production-ready code. The Designer provides a *blank canvas* with full control over HTML, CSS, and animations in a visual interface.

In conclusion, Webflow’s product suite – from the core Designer/CMS/Ecommerce, through the Developer tools and Hosting, to the Collaboration and AI features – positions Webflow as a **leading Website Experience Platform**. It counterpositions itself against traditional web development (offering speed and cost savings), against other site builders (offering far greater custom capability and now similar scale features), and even against headless/enterprise systems (offering a composable, visual-first approach with enterprise-grade add-ons at a more accessible price). With both officially launched features and cutting-edge betas (Logic/Memberships learnings, AI, Cloud, etc.), Webflow shows a commitment to innovation in service of all its user segments: empowering everyone to create **world-class web experiences** without the traditional bottlenecks of coding or coordination.
